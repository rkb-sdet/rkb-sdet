    <h1 class="post-title">QA vs QC vs QE</h1>
    <p>
      Understanding the distinction between Quality Assurance (QA), Quality Control (QC), and Quality Engineering (QE) is essential for effective software quality management. Each plays a unique role in the delivery of reliable software products.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Quality Assurance (QA)</h2>
    <p>
      <b>QA</b> involves the proactive process of establishing, monitoring, and improving development methodologies, standards, and procedures. Its goal is to prevent defects by ensuring quality is built into the process from the outset.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on <b>processes</b> and <b>prevention</b></li>
      <li>Includes reviews, audits, and process improvement</li>
      <li>Team-wide responsibility throughout SDLC</li>
      <li>Examples: Requirement reviews, design walkthroughs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Quality Control (QC)</h2>
    <p>
      <b>QC</b> is a reactive activity that evaluates the final product to detect and correct defects. It is product-oriented and typically occurs after development, ensuring deliverables meet the specified standards.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on <b>products</b> and <b>defect identification</b></li>
      <li>Includes testing, inspection, validation</li>
      <li>Typically performed by dedicated testing teams</li>
      <li>Examples: System testing, defect reporting, inspections</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Quality Engineering (QE)</h2>
    <p>
      <b>QE</b> bridges the gap between QA and QC by incorporating quality throughout the development lifecycle. Quality Engineers use technical skills, automation, and DevOps practices to prevent defects and ensure quality at every stage of the pipeline.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrates <b>proactive prevention</b> and <b>continuous improvement</b> with engineering</li>
      <li>Automation, CI/CD, and performance testing are core practices</li>
      <li>Works closely with development teams from design to delivery</li>
      <li>Examples: Automated test scripts, code integration, early risk detection</li>
    </ul>
