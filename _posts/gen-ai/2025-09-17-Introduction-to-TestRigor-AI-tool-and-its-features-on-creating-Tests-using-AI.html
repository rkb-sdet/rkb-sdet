    <h1 class="post-title">Demo: testRigor AI Testing Tool in Action</h1>

    <p>
      This demo illustrates how <span class="highlight">testRigor</span>—a leading AI-powered test automation platform—translates business requirements in plain English directly into running end-to-end test cases. The goal is not hands-on training, but a base-level demonstration of the direction in which intelligent QA tooling is heading.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Getting Started with testRigor</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign up for a free individual account, login, and start by creating a <span class="highlight">TestSuite</span> for your application or website.</li>
      <li>Input requirements in everyday language, such as:
        <br><code>search for vegetables and make sure it return results</code>
        <br><code>add items to the cart and select proceed to checkout</code>
        <br><code>apply random promo code, select country, accept terms, click proceed, and verify thank you message is displayed</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">How Plain English Translates to Automation</h2>
    <p>
      testRigor’s <span class="highlight">TestEngine</span> interprets high-level requirements to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create detailed <span class="highlight">TestStep</span> objects (search, click, fill fields, validate messages) and generate both manual test scripts and executable automation code.</li>
      <li>Navigates through your web application, interacts with <span class="highlight">WebElement</span> objects, fills forms, makes assertions—all without coding or writing selectors.</li>
      <li>Supports cross-browser, cross-OS execution, and can schedule or integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines via the <span class="highlight">RunManager</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Observing the Demo Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automates navigation, <span class="highlight">ItemSelection</span>, <span class="highlight">CartAction</span>, and full checkout, completing even complex flows with screenshots for each <span class="highlight">TestStep</span>.</li>
      <li>Demonstrates strong capabilities by "guessing" missing data (like <span class="highlight">CountrySelector</span>) to keep tests running smoothly if requirements are generic.</li>
      <li>Some generated test cases may need further edits for accuracy, but the <span class="highlight">BaseImplementation</span> is fast and robust.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Key Features Highlighted</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automated Script Generation:</strong> Create test scenarios using plain language requirements handled by <span class="highlight">ScriptBuilder</span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Healing Tests:</strong> <span class="highlight">LocatorManager</span> detects and updates changing UI elements automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Intelligent Reporting:</strong> Visual evidence of each <span class="highlight">TestRun</span> is provided along with grouped failure reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>Codeless Enhancements:</strong> Use <span class="highlight">TestEditor</span> for easy adjustments as requirements or UI change.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      AI-powered testing tools like testRigor empower you to move from requirements to working automation scripts in minutes, not days.  
      While not always 100% accurate out of the box, they accelerate repetitive QA, reduce manual effort, and pave the way for dramatic productivity gains as the technology matures.
