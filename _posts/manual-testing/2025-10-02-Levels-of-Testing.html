    <h1 class="post-title">Levels of Testing</h1>
    <p>
      Levels of testing refer to the different stages in the software testing process, each focusing on verifying and validating software at various scopes, from individual components to the entire system. Properly structured levels help ensure thorough testing coverage and quality assurance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">1. Unit Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Unit testing is the first and lowest level, focusing on individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It is typically done by developers to validate that each unit performs as expected.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tests smallest testable parts like functions or classes.</li>
      <li>Helps detect and fix bugs early in development.</li>
      <li>Usually automated with tools like JUnit, TestNG.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">2. Integration Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Integration testing checks the interaction and data flow between multiple modules when combined. It focuses on uncovering interface defects and ensuring different parts work together harmoniously.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validates combined functionality of integrated units.</li>
      <li>Can be of types like Big-Bang, Top-Down, Bottom-Up.</li>
      <li>Usually performed by testers or developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">3. System Testing</h2>
    <p>
      System testing tests the complete and integrated software to verify it meets all specified requirements. This end-to-end testing checks functional, performance, security, and usability aspects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validates overall behavior of the system.</li>
      <li>Performed in an environment similar to production.</li>
      <li>Usually performed by QA teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">4. Acceptance Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Acceptance testing is the final level, where the software is validated against customer or user requirements. It ensures the system is ready for deployment and satisfies business needs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Operational Acceptance Testing.</li>
      <li>Performed by end users, clients, or stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Determines whether the software can be released.</li>
    </ul>

      <b>Tip:</b> Each testing level adds a layer of verification to catch defects early and ensure a reliable, high-quality software product.
