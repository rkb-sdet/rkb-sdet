    <h1 class="post-title">Getting Started with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code</h1>

    <p>
      GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered pair programmer that integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), helping developers write, fix, and optimize code efficiently.  
      This guide covers installation, setup, and highlights key features to transform your coding workflow.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Step 1: Installing GitHub Copilot Extensions</h2>
    <p>
      In VS Code, open the Extensions pane (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).  
      Search for "GitHub Copilot" and you will find two main extensions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>: The core AI pair programming assistant.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Copilot Chat</strong>: Enables chat-based coding assistance and explanations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Install both extensions for a complete experience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Step 2: Sign In and Activation</h2>
    <p>
      After installation, VS Code will prompt you to sign in to your GitHub account.  
      Make sure you have an active GitHub account before proceeding.  
      The sign-in process will redirect you to a browser where you grant permission and activate your Copilot subscription—free trials are available for 30 days.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Step 3: Exploring Copilot Features</h2>
    <p>
      Once activated, GitHub Copilot acts like an AI coworker in your IDE:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Suggests code completions and snippets inline as you type.</li>
      <li>Helps search for method definitions and usages across your workspace.</li>
      <li>Assists in optimizing and refactoring existing code on request.</li>
      <li>Generates boilerplate code based on natural language comments or minimal inputs.</li>
      <li>Supports creating new files and writing test code (including unit and API tests) quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Step 4: Engaging with Copilot in VS Code</h2>
    <p>
      Use the "Open Chat" feature to ask questions or request code generation.  
      You can instruct Copilot to search your workspace for specific methods or files, refactor code for performance improvements, or help fix syntax errors with simple natural language prompts.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can even request bulk edits, such as adding author tags across multiple files or adapt code style to your project’s standards.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Step 5: Leveraging Copilot for Complete Automation Workflows</h2>
    <p>
      Copilot helps not just with writing tests but integrating with frameworks like Playwright for UI/API automation, generating data-driven test scripts, and generating commands to run specific tests from the terminal—all through simple prompts.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Why Use GitHub Copilot?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Increase Productivity:</strong> Write code faster with AI-assisted suggestions.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce Cognitive Load:</strong> Let Copilot handle repetitive or boilerplate code.</li>
      <li><strong>Boost Learning:</strong> Use AI suggestions to understand best practices and new language features.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve Code Quality:</strong> Get instant fixes and optimizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Final Tips</h2>
    <p>
      Ensure you review all AI-generated code carefully before committing. Use Copilot as an assistant—not a replacement—for your programming expertise.  
      Embrace the AI pair programmer mindset for effective, efficient software development.
