    <h1 class="post-title">Error, Defect (Bug), Failure</h1>
    <p>
      In software testing, it is important to understand the differences between Error, Defect (also called Bug), and Failure, as these terms describe different stages and perspectives of software problems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is an Error?</h2>
    <p>
      An <b>Error</b> is a human action that produces an incorrect result. It usually occurs due to mistakes by developers such as wrong logic, syntax errors, or misunderstanding requirements while coding. Errors are introduced during the development phase.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is a Defect (Bug)?</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>Defect</b> (or <b>Bug</b>) is a variance or deviation from the expected behavior of the software. It occurs when the software does not perform according to the requirement specification. Defects are identified during testing or after deployment by testers or end users.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defects represent flaws or imperfections in the software.</li>
      <li>Bugs is an informal term used interchangeably with defects.</li>
      <li>Defects arise due to errors in code or design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is a Failure?</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>Failure</b> occurs when the software behaves unexpectedly or stops working during execution. Failures are the visible outcomes of one or more defects or faults that cause the system to lose its intended functionality.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Failures are typically found by end users or during system testing.</li>
      <li>They represent the inability of the software to perform its required functions.</li>
    </ul>

          <td>Failure</td>
          <td>When software does not meet requirements or stops working during execution.</td>
          <td>Observed by users or testers during testing or production.</td>

      <b>Tip:</b> Errors create defects, and defects, when executed, may lead to failures. Effective testing aims to catch defects before they cause failures in production.
