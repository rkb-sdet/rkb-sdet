      Understanding Page Object Design Pattern (POM) in Selenium
    </h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>Page Object Model (POM)</strong> is a design pattern widely
      used in Selenium automation to improve test maintenance and reduce code
      duplication. It helps separate test logic from the UI element locators by
      encapsulating web elements and page actions inside dedicated page classes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Why Use Page Object Model?</h2>
    <p>
      In standalone tests, locators are often repeated across multiple tests,
      leading to high maintenance overhead. For example, if a login form's
      username field changes its ID, you'd need to update all tests referencing
      that locator individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      This repetitive update task becomes unmanageable in large suites with many
      tests and locators. POM addresses this by centralizing locators and
      associated methods inside page-specific classes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">How Page Object Model Works</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of one large file containing all locators, create a separate class
      for each page or significant part of your web application. For example,
      have <code>LoginPage.java</code>, <code>ProductCatalogPage.java</code>,
      and <code>CheckoutPage.java</code> classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each page class contains locators and methods specific to that page,
      making the code cleaner and modular. Tests then interact only with these
      page objects, calling their methods rather than managing locators
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This modular design helps isolate locator changes. If a locator on the
      login page changes, update it only inside the
      <code>LoginPage</code> class. All tests relying on that page object will
      automatically use the updated locator without any further changes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Benefits of Using POM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Improved maintainability by reducing duplicated locator definitions.
      </li>
      <li>Better readability and organization of test code.</li>
      <li>Reduced risk of test failures due to locator changes.</li>
      <li>
        Manageable and scalable test suites suitable for large applications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Without POM, updating a single locator across many tests can be tedious
      and error-prone. With POM, locators are centralized in page classes,
      making updates quick and lowering test maintenance efforts. Proper use of
      POM design pattern leads to cleaner, modular, and professional test
      automation frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In upcoming posts, we will implement these concepts practically in our
      Selenium framework.
