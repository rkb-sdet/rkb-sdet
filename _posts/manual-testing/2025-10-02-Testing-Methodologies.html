    <h1 class="post-title">Testing Methodologies</h1>
    <p>
      Testing methodologies are structured approaches and strategies used to test software products effectively. They guide how testing activities are planned, designed, executed, and managed to ensure that the product meets quality standards and user requirements.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Popular Software Testing Methodologies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Waterfall Model:</b> A linear and sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing) is completed before the next begins. Testing happens after implementation, suitable for projects with stable requirements.</li>
      <li><b>Agile Methodology:</b> An iterative and incremental approach emphasizing flexibility, team collaboration, and continuous delivery. Testing is integrated throughout the development lifecycle using short iterations or sprints.</li>
      <li><b>Iterative/Incremental Model:</b> Software is developed and tested in small parts (increments) repeatedly. Each cycle builds upon a previous version allowing early defect detection and progressive refinement.</li>
      <li><b>V-Model (Verification & Validation):</b> An extension of Waterfall linking testing phases directly to corresponding development stages. For every development activity, there is a related testing phase ensuring early defect detection.</li>
      <li><b>Spiral Model:</b> A risk-driven, iterative model where cycles (spirals) involve planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. It combines waterfall and prototyping elements, ideal for large and high-risk projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Choosing the Right Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The choice depends on project size, requirements stability, risk factors, team expertise, and customer involvement. Agile is preferred for dynamic projects with changing needs, while Waterfall suits projects with clear, fixed requirements.
