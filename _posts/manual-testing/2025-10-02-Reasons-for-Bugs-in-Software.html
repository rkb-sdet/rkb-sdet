    <h1 class="post-title">Reasons for Bugs in Software</h1>
    <p>
      Bugs in software are inevitable due to various factors stemming from human, technical, and process-related causes. Understanding these reasons helps teams improve software quality by preventing and mitigating defects effectively.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Common Causes of Software Bugs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Human Error:</b> Mistakes made by developers, testers, or analysts during coding, designing, or requirements gathering. Examples include typographical errors, logic flaws, or overlooking details.</li>
      <li><b>Incomplete or Ambiguous Requirements:</b> Poorly defined, unclear, or frequently changing requirements can cause misunderstood functionality and incorrect implementations.</li>
      <li><b>Poor Design or Architecture:</b> Flawed system design can lead to performance issues, scalability problems, and difficult maintainability, which increase the chances of bugs.</li>
      <li><b>Inadequate Testing:</b> Insufficient or ineffective test coverage misses defects. Lack of testing in real-world scenarios or environments increases the risk of bugs escaping to production.</li>
      <li><b>Communication Gaps:</b> Miscommunication among stakeholders, developers, and testers causes misunderstandings and incorrect assumptions resulting in defects.</li>
      <li><b>Complexity of Software:</b> Highly complex systems with many interdependent components increase the likelihood of errors and defects.</li>
      <li><b>Time Pressure and Deadlines:</b> Rushed development and testing due to tight schedules reduce thoroughness and increase mistakes.</li>
      <li><b>Tool and Environment Issues:</b> Bugs in third-party tools, improper use of development/testing tools, or incompatible environments can introduce defects.</li>
      <li><b>Improper Change Management:</b> Uncontrolled or poorly managed changes to code, requirements, or test cases may cause new bugs or regression issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear and thorough requirements gathering with stakeholder involvement.</li>
      <li>Implement code reviews, pair programming, and design reviews.</li>
      <li>Perform comprehensive test planning and automate regression testing.</li>
      <li>Maintain effective communication channels between all teams.</li>
      <li>Adopt agile and iterative development to accommodate changes smoothly.</li>
    </ul>
