    <h1 class="post-title">SDLC Models: Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral, V-Model, Agile</h1>
    <p>
      In software engineering, there are various Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models designed to manage the development process. Each model has unique principles, strengths, and use-cases. Here’s a summary of the key SDLC models:
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Waterfall Model</h2>
    <p>
      The Waterfall model is linear and sequential, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It's simple and well-structured, best suited for projects with well-defined requirements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance</li>
      <li><b>Advantages:</b> Easy to manage, clear documentation, strong control at each phase.</li>
      <li><b>Limitations:</b> Inflexible to change, late issue discovery, little user feedback during development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Incremental Model</h2>
    <p>
      The Incremental model develops the software in small, manageable pieces (increments). Each increment adds functionality, building upon what was done previously.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each phase is repeated for every new increment.</li>
      <li>Allows partial implementation and early delivery of working software.</li>
      <li><b>Advantages:</b> Deliverables after every increment, flexible, easier debugging.</li>
      <li><b>Limitations:</b> Planning and integration can be complex as increments grow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Spiral Model</h2>
    <p>
      The Spiral model integrates iterative development with risk analysis. Development loops through repeated cycles (spirals), focusing on risk management and customer feedback in each cycle.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Four stages: Identification, Design, Build, Evaluate & Risk Analysis.</li>
      <li>Best for large, complex, high-risk projects.</li>
      <li><b>Advantages:</b> Risk management, flexibility, stakeholder feedback in every cycle.</li>
      <li><b>Limitations:</b> High cost, complex management, not ideal for small projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)</h2>
    <p>
      The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall, emphasizing testing at every development stage. Each development phase is paired with a corresponding testing activity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requirements ↔ Acceptance Testing, Design ↔ System Testing, Implementation ↔ Unit Testing</li>
      <li><b>Advantages:</b> Rigorous testing, progress is easier to track, ideal for small/medium projects needing high quality.</li>
      <li><b>Limitations:</b> Still inflexible, no early prototypes, changes are hard to accommodate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Agile Model</h2>
    <p>
      The Agile model emphasizes iterative, incremental development, adaptability, and strong customer collaboration. Software is delivered in small, rapid releases with continuous feedback.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work is divided into short iterations (typically 2-4 weeks).</li>
      <li>Teams adapt to change and involve stakeholders throughout the process.</li>
      <li><b>Advantages:</b> High flexibility, quick response to change, early and frequent delivery, customer involvement.</li>
      <li><b>Limitations:</b> Requires experienced team, limited documentation, less suitable for strict regulatory projects.</li>
    </ul>

      <b>Tip:</b> Choose the SDLC model that best fits your project's needs, size, complexity, and requirement stability. Each offers unique benefits for different scenarios.
