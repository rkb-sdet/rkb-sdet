    <h1 class="post-title">What is Software Testing?</h1>
    <p>
      Software Testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system functions as intended and meets the specified requirements. It is a critical activity within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) aimed at identifying defects or bugs, ensuring the software is reliable, efficient, and satisfies user expectations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Purpose of Software Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Verification:</b> Ensures the software is being built correctly according to design specifications — "Are we building the product the right way?"</li>
      <li><b>Validation:</b> Confirms that the final product meets the user's actual needs — "Are we building the right product?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Importance of Software Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Detects defects early, reducing cost and effort for fixing post-release bugs.</li>
      <li>Improves software quality, security, and performance.</li>
      <li>Ensures the system meets customer and user requirements.</li>
      <li>Increases customer satisfaction and confidence in the product.</li>
      <li>Supports risk mitigation by uncovering critical problems timely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Types of Software Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Software testing broadly divides into:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Functional Testing:</b> Validates software functions according to specifications.</li>
      <li><b>Non-Functional Testing:</b> Assesses aspects such as performance, usability, reliability, and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Testing Approaches</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Manual Testing:</b> Human testers execute test cases without automation.</li>
      <li><b>Automated Testing:</b> Use of scripts and tools to perform tests efficiently and repeatedly.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <b>Tip:</b> Incorporate testing early in development for best results, embracing both verification and validation to deliver a high-quality product.
