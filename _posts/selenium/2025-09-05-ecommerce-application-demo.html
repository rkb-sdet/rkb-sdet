      Designing an End-to-End Selenium Test for E-commerce Automation
    </h1>

    <p>
      Welcome back to the Selenium automation series! To start designing a
      robust framework, we first need a solid, end-to-end test case.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Using a Sample E-commerce Application</h2>
    <p>
      We'll use the
      <a href="https://rahulshettyacademy.com/client" target="_blank">
        Rahul Shetty Academy demo e-commerce site
      </a>
      as our example app. <strong>Important:</strong> Use the URL ending with
      <code>/client</code>. Avoid going directly to authentication or login URLs
      to prevent errors.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Test Flow Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Create a dummy user account</strong> on the site with any random
        email and password you can remember.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Login</strong> with your created credentials.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Select a product</strong> (e.g., Zara Coat 3) from the product
        listing page visible after login.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Validate</strong> that the "product added to cart" message
        appears as confirmation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Navigate to cart</strong> and confirm the selected products are
        displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fill in the checkout form</strong> with your personal details
        and select your country by typing to search.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Place the order</strong> and ensure you land on the confirmation
        page with a thank-you message.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grab the order ID(s)</strong> from the confirmation to use later
        for verification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Verify orders in the order history tab</strong> to ensure all
        orders you placed are listed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>View order details</strong> for accuracy of information such as
        country and other form data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete orders</strong> and confirm success messages and removal
        from the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Return to shopping</strong> to repeat or place additional
        orders.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This test scenario covers a full user journey from login, product
      selection, checkout, to order history verification.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      In the next 30 minutes, we will develop a standalone Selenium test script
      that automates this entire workflow. This standalone test will later be
      enhanced with framework best practices including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Page Object Model (POM)</li>
      <li>Data-driven testing</li>
      <li>Parallel test execution</li>
      <li>Robust reports and retry logic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Prepare your dummy user accounts in advance for
      smooth automation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stay tuned for the hands-on demo where we automate login, product
      selection, cart validation, and order placement seamlessly with Selenium!
