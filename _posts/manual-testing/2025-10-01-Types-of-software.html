    <p>
      Software can be broadly classified into different types based on their purpose, functionality, and use. Below are the primary types:
    </p>
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">1. System Software</h2>
    <p>
      System software acts as a bridge between the hardware and the user applications. It manages the computerâ€™s resources and provides a platform for other software to run.
      Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)</li>
      <li>Device Drivers</li>
      <li>Utility Programs</li>
      <li>Firmware</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">2. Application Software</h2>
    <p>
      Application software is designed to help users perform specific tasks. These are directly used by end users to fulfill their requirements.
      Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Business software (Accounting, Inventory management)</li>
      <li>Office suites (MS Word, Excel)</li>
      <li>Media players</li>
      <li>Games and educational software</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">3. Programming Software</h2>
    <p>
      Programming software provides tools to write, test, and maintain other software programs.
      Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compilers</li>
      <li>Debuggers</li>
      <li>Interpreters</li>
      <li>Code editors and IDEs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Other Notable Types</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Embedded Software:</b> Software embedded into hardware devices like microwaves, automobiles, and medical instruments.</li>
      <li><b>Utility Software:</b> Software that performs maintenance tasks such as disk cleanup, antivirus, backup utilities.</li>
      <li><b>Network Software:</b> Software that facilitates networking and communication between systems, including network operating systems and network management tools.</li>
    </ul>
