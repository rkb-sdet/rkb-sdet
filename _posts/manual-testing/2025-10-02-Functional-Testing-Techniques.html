    <h1 class="post-title">Detailed Explanation of Functional Testing Techniques</h1>
    <p>
      Functional testing incorporates various techniques to systematically verify the software's features and functionalities. Here’s a detailed look at each technique:
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Unit Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Unit Testing focuses on testing the smallest parts of an application, typically individual functions or methods, in isolation. It ensures each unit behaves as expected before integration with other units. This testing is commonly automated and done by developers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Integration Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Integration Testing verifies the interactions between integrated modules or components. It ensures that combined parts work together correctly and data flows accurately across modules. This helps catch interface issues early in the development cycle.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">System Testing</h2>
    <p>
      System Testing involves testing the fully integrated software system against its requirements. This end-to-end testing validates both functional and non-functional aspects, such as security, performance, and usability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h2>
    <p>
      UAT is conducted by the end users or clients in a real-world or simulated environment. It confirms whether the system meets business requirements and is ready for production deployment. UAT ensures user satisfaction before final release.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Regression Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Regression Testing is the process of re-executing tests after changes such as bug fixes or new feature additions to ensure that existing functionality is unaffected. Automated testing is frequently used here to save time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Smoke Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Smoke Testing is a quick, preliminary test to verify that the critical functions of a software build are working properly. It acts as a gatekeeper before the software goes through more rigorous testing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Sanity Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Sanity Testing is a narrow and focused test to check that specific bugs or functionalities have been fixed or work as expected after minor changes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">End-to-End Testing (E2E)</h2>
    <p>
      E2E Testing validates complete workflows of an application including interactions with databases, networks, and other systems ensuring the entire process flows smoothly from start to finish.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Equivalence Partitioning</h2>
    <p>
      This technique divides input data into equivalent partitions that are expected to produce similar results, reducing the total number of test cases while maintaining good coverage.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Boundary Value Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Boundary Value Analysis tests the edge cases at the boundaries of input ranges. It is effective because errors often occur at these extremes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Decision Table Testing</h2>
    <p>
      This technique uses tables to represent different input conditions and the corresponding expected outputs. It’s useful to design tests for complex business rules and combinations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">State Transition Testing</h2>
    <p>
      State Transition Testing evaluates the behavior of an application when it changes states based on events, inputs, or conditions. It verifies all possible state changes and transitions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Ad Hoc Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Ad Hoc Testing is informal testing without structured test cases. It relies on tester intuition and experience to find defects quickly, often used when there are time constraints.
