    <h1 class="post-title">Few-Shot Prompting: Using Examples to Guide AI</h1>

    <p>
      In the previous sections, we explored
      <strong>zero-shot prompting</strong> and how refining prompts with
      <span class="highlight">context, constraints, and clarity</span> improves
      responses. Now, let’s look at another practical technique:
      <span class="highlight">Few-Shot Prompting</span>. Instead of just giving
      AI detailed instructions, you supply examples of the expected output
      format. This helps the model understand exactly how you want your results
      structured.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">1. Why Few-Shot Prompting Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Many testers often give vague prompts like
      <em>"Write test cases for login page."</em> The problem is that AI might
      generate random or overly broad test cases. Instead, by providing
      <span class="highlight">examples of expected structure</span>, you guide
      the AI to deliver focused and formatted outputs aligned to your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a real sprint environment, testers don’t usually write all test cases
      for an entire system at once. Instead, they focus on specific stories,
      like
      <strong>valid login</strong>, <strong>invalid login</strong>, or
      <strong>forgot password</strong>. Few-shot prompting helps in such cases
      by showing AI not only <em>what</em> to generate but also <em>how</em> to
      present it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">
      2. Adding Constraints for Better Test Case Output
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Specify the role:
        <em>"You are a QA engineer working on an e-commerce site."</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Define scope: focus on
        <strong>valid login, invalid login, and forgot password</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>Ask for <strong>positive and negative test cases</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        Include environment constraints: e.g.,
        <em>"Browsers: Chrome & Firefox."</em>
      </li>
      <li>Request a specific format (e.g., a table with defined columns).</li>
      <li>
        Add <strong>priority levels</strong> for each test case (High, Medium,
        Low).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      Example Refined Prompt: <br />
      <em>
        "You are a QA engineer testing an e-commerce site. Write test cases only
        for login functionality (valid login, invalid login, forgot password).
        Include positive and negative scenarios. Cover Firefox and Chrome
        browsers. Provide results in a table format with columns: Test Case ID,
        Scenario, Steps, Expected Result, Browser, Priority."
      </em>
    </div>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">3. What is Few-Shot Prompting?</h2>
    <p>
      Few-shot prompting means providing a couple of
      <strong>sample outputs</strong> in advance so the AI knows how to
      structure subsequent answers. This saves time and avoids repeatedly
      clarifying your needs.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You ask a question: <em>"Write test case for valid login."</em></li>
      <li>
        You provide an example test case in the format you expect (a table or
        steps).
      </li>
      <li>
        The AI uses both your question and your example to generate test cases
        for other scenarios (invalid login, forgot password, etc.).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">
      4. Example of Few-Shot Prompting for Login Test Cases
    </h2>

    <p>Sample input for few-shot prompting could look like this:</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Example Prompt with Format:</strong><br />
      "You are a QA engineer. Here is the format I want you to follow:"
      <br /><br />
      <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <th>Test Case ID</th>
          <th>Scenario</th>
          <th>Steps</th>
          <th>Expected Result</th>
          <th>Browser</th>
          <th>Priority</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TC001</td>
          <td>Valid Login</td>
          <td>
            1. Launch site<br />2. Navigate to Login<br />3. Enter valid
            credentials<br />4. Click Login
          </td>
          <td>User is successfully logged in and redirected to Dashboard</td>
          <td>Chrome, Firefox</td>
          <td>High</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br />
      "Now generate test cases for <em>Invalid Login</em> and
      <em>Forgot Password</em> using the same format."
    </div>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">5. Benefits of Few-Shot Prompting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency:</strong> AI follows the exact structured format you
        provide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Time-Saving:</strong> Avoids converting free-text into tables
        later.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customization:</strong> Ensures prompts align with your team’s
        reporting standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Selective Scope:</strong> Limits output only to what you
        actually want.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">6. Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Few-shot prompting uses <strong>examples</strong> to guide output
        formatting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always include role (context), scope (constraints), and structure
        (clarity).
      </li>
      <li>
        This technique is highly effective when writing structured outputs, like
        test cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combining <span class="highlight">technical skills</span> with
        <span class="highlight">smart prompting</span> gives you an edge in QA
        and automation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the next section, we will discuss another prompting strategy that
      builds on this concept, helping you handle
      <strong>iterative refinement</strong> when initial outputs aren’t perfect.
