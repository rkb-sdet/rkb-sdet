    <h1 class="post-title">Real-Time End-to-End Test Automation with AI: Rahul Shetty Academy Client Portal Example</h1>

    <p>
      This practical example showcases how AI can accelerate the end-to-end automation testing process—covering requirement to script generation—on the Rahul Shetty Academy client portal.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Exploring the Order History Feature (Test Case UA-07)</h2>

    <p>
      The test case involves logging into the portal, navigating to the order history page, and verifying that past orders display accurate details such as order number, date, and status.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">AI-Generated Cucumber Gherkin Feature File and Step Definitions</h2>

    <p>
      By prompting AI with the test case ID and order table column details, it generates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A structured Cucumber Gherkin feature file with a <code>Background</code> section for login and pertinent scenarios to validate order history display.</li>
      <li>Playwright JavaScript step definitions that dynamically locate table columns and iterate through rows to assert correctness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Leveraging HTML Inspection for Locator Generation</h2>

    <p>
      AI can further utilize the outer HTML of the order table copied from the browser’s inspect tool to produce precise locators and interaction code.  
      This automation saves manual effort in locator discovery, XPath/CSS crafting, and validation logic implementation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Refactoring into Page Object Model</h2>

    <p>
      To align with best practices, AI can transform raw step definitions by extracting locators into dedicated page object classes.  
      This increases code maintainability and reusability, following team framework standards.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Multi-Language and Framework Support</h2>

    <p>
      The same AI-driven generation supports switching frameworks and languages effortlessly.   
      Convert between Playwright JavaScript, Playwright TypeScript, or Selenium Java seamlessly by prompting the AI accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Why Human Oversight Remains Essential</h2>

    <p>
      Though AI provides up to 70% accurate working code, human expertise is necessary to tailor locators, handle exceptions, integrate with specific project configurations, and maintain test stability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Summary</h2>

    <p>
      From requirements through test cases and data to fully coded, framework-compatible automation scripts—AI tools coupled with strategic prompt engineering dramatically speed up and simplify QA workflows.  
      This real-time example from Rahul Shetty Academy’s client portal illustrates the future of efficient test automation in practice.
