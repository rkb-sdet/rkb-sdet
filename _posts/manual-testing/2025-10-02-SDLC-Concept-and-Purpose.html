    <h1 class="post-title">SDLC Concept and Purpose</h1>
    <p>
      The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured and systematic process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software. It provides a clear framework of phases and activities, ensuring that the final product meets the needs of customers and stakeholders.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is SDLC?</h2>
    <p>
      SDLC defines the complete journey of software developmentâ€”from initial planning and requirements gathering through design, coding, testing, deployment, and ultimately maintenance and retirement. By following SDLC processes, teams can efficiently build software that is cost-effective, reliable, and of high quality.
