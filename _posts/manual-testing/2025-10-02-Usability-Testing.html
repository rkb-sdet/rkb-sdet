    <h1 class="post-title">Usability Testing</h1>
    <p>
      Usability Testing is a type of software testing focused on evaluating how easy, efficient, and satisfying a software product is to use from an end user's perspective. It involves observing real users as they interact with the application to identify pain points, confusion, or barriers that affect user experience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is Usability Testing?</h2>
    <p>
      This testing method assesses the systemâ€™s navigation, functionality, and overall design to ensure it meets the real needs of users. Unlike other testing types that focus on functional correctness, usability testing centers on user behaviour, task completion, and satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Key Objectives of Usability Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluate user-friendliness and intuitiveness of the software interface.</li>
      <li>Identify areas where users face difficulty or errors while performing tasks.</li>
      <li>Gather feedback to improve design, layout, and functionality.</li>
      <li>Ensure the product meets customer expectations and provides a seamless experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Types of Usability Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Moderated Testing:</b> Conducted with a facilitator guiding users and asking questions during interaction.</li>
      <li><b>Unmoderated Testing:</b> Users perform tasks independently in their own environment, usually via online tools.</li>
      <li><b>Remote Testing:</b> Users are geographically dispersed, testing from their own locations.</li>
      <li><b>In-person Testing:</b> Conducted in a controlled environment such as a usability lab with direct observation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Why is Usability Testing Important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures the software is easy to use and meets real-world user needs.</li>
      <li>Reduces costly redesigns by identifying problems early.</li>
      <li>Enhances user satisfaction and retention.</li>
      <li>Improves overall product quality and competitiveness.</li>
    </ul>

      <b>Tip:</b> Usability testing should be iterative, performed continuously throughout the software development lifecycle to refine and optimize user experience.
