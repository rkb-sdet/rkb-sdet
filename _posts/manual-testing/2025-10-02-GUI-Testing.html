    <h1 class="post-title">GUI Testing</h1>
    <p>
      GUI (Graphical User Interface) Testing is the process of verifying the user interface of a software application to ensure it functions correctly, looks as expected, and provides a good user experience. It focuses on elements such as buttons, menus, icons, text fields, images, and overall layout.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What Does GUI Testing Involve?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Checking the presence and correct appearance of UI elements like fonts, colors, labels, and icons.</li>
      <li>Validating that user interactions (clicking, typing, scrolling) trigger the intended behaviors.</li>
      <li>Ensuring interface consistency across different devices, screen resolutions, and browsers.</li>
      <li>Verifying accessibility to users with disabilities through standards compliance.</li>
      <li>Identifying usability issues such as navigation flow, readability, and response times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Types of GUI Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Functional Testing:</b> Validate UI elements perform as required.</li>
      <li><b>Usability Testing:</b> Ensure the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
      <li><b>Compatibility Testing:</b> Test UI on multiple browsers, devices, and OS.</li>
      <li><b>Accessibility Testing:</b> Confirm software is usable by people with disabilities.</li>
      <li><b>Regression Testing:</b> Ensure recent changes do not break existing UI functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Manual vs Automated GUI Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Manual GUI testing involves testers interacting with the application as users would, giving insight into user experience nuances. Automated GUI testing uses tools like Selenium or Ranorex to simulate user actions and validate UI elements efficiently, especially for repetitive regression tests.
