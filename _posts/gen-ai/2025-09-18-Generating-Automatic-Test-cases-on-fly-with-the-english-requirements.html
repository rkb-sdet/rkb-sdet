    <h1 class="post-title">Evolving Test Case Generation: Plain English to Automation with testRigor</h1>

    <p>
      TestRigor takes QA productivity to the next level by letting users generate comprehensive manual and automated test cases for each feature update—simply by describing requirements in plain English. This demo illustrates how new feature requirements, like coupon code validations, are instantly transformed into logically grouped tests and, with one click, into automated runs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Manual and AI-Driven Test Case Generation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start by updating your <span class="highlight">TestSuite</span> with a new feature description, such as: <code>check coupon field validations</code>.</li>
      <li>Let <span class="highlight">testRigor</span> AI suggest the full range of cases: valid coupon, expired/invalid cases, empty field, and error messages.</li>
      <li>Review, edit, or build these tests into automation scripts—<span class="highlight">TestSuiteRunner</span> executes and reports results with minimal human intervention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">How testRigor Converts Requirements to Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Initially, test developers use <span class="highlight">TestRigorConventions</span>—specific, natural-language action patterns like <code>enter "FREE50" into "Coupon Code"</code> or <code>click "Apply"</code>.</li>
      <li>With evolving AI capabilities, you can describe steps in your own terms. The <span class="highlight">AIGenerator</span> translates free-form English into the standardized testRigor format, then to automation code.</li>
      <li>This layered conversion means even non-technical team members or business analysts can write high-level requirements and see them executed as working tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Advantages of the testRigor Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human-centric:</strong> Reduces learning curve for non-coders via conventions, or enables pure English case design with AI translation.</li>
      <li><strong>Codeless QA:</strong> <span class="highlight">ScriptEngine</span> generates robust test logic—no selector or code-writing required.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> AI adapts to varied inputs, increasingly understanding unique ways people describe steps and validations.</li>
      <li><strong>Stability & self-healing:</strong> <span class="highlight">LocatorResolver</span> automatically adapts to UI changes for ultra-stable regression testing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">AI-powered vs. General LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini)</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike general purpose LLMs, which require specific HTML or locator details, testRigor’s purpose-built QA stack actually interacts with live web pages—navigating, scraping, and acting on elements using a deep understanding of test flows and app structure. This enables true <span class="highlight">ContextualAutomation</span> with no manual locators.
    </p>
    <p>
      General LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini are best for generic code generation and learning, but testRigor is specialized for <span class="highlight">business-driven UI automation</span> at scale.
