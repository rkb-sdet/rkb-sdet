    <h1 class="post-title">Product vs Project</h1>
    <p>
      In software development, it is important to understand the difference between a <b>Product</b> and a <b>Project</b>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is a Project?</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>Project</b> is a software application developed to meet the specific requirements of a single customer or client. It is usually tailored and customized for individual needs and is delivered for that particular customer.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is a Product?</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>Product</b> is a software application developed for multiple customers or a wider market. It is designed to meet the general needs of many users and is usually released to the public or multiple organizations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Key Differences</h2>
