    <h1 class="post-title">Verification vs Validation</h1>
    <p>
      Verification and Validation are two crucial concepts in software quality assurance. They are often used together but serve different purposes in ensuring software quality and correctness.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is Verification?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Verification</b> is the process of evaluating intermediate work products of a software development lifecycle to ensure that the software is being built “right” — that is, according to the prescribed requirements and design specifications. It typically involves activities such as reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections, without executing the code.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Answers the question: <b>Are we building the product right?</b></li>
      <li>Static process — focuses on documentation, design, and code reviews.</li>
      <li>Conducted throughout development before actual software execution.</li>
      <li>Prevents errors by ensuring requirements are properly implemented at each stage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is Validation?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Validation</b> is the process of evaluating the final product to check whether it meets the actual needs and expectations of the end users and stakeholders. This is done by executing the software and validating its behavior in real or simulated environments.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Answers the question: <b>Are we building the right product?</b></li>
      <li>Dynamic process — involves activities like functional, system, and user acceptance testing.</li>
      <li>Conducted after development, on the working product.</li>
      <li>Confirms that the software fulfills business needs and user requirements.</li>
    </ul>
