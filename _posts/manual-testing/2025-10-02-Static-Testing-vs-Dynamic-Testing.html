    <h1 class="post-title">Static Testing vs Dynamic Testing</h1>
    <p>
      Static and dynamic testing are two foundational approaches in software quality assurance, each serving different purposes in identifying issues and improving software reliability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is Static Testing?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Static Testing</b> involves examining and evaluating software artifacts such as requirements, design documents, and source code without executing the program. Its goal is to detect defects early in the development process, preventing bugs before code execution.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes activities like reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and static analysis.</li>
      <li>Conducted during initial project stages, before deployment.</li>
      <li>Cost-effective and helps catch issues earlier.</li>
      <li>Examples: Requirement review, code review, checklist-based document analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What is Dynamic Testing?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Dynamic Testing</b> involves executing the software to validate its behavior. This approach analyzes how the application functions in real time and verifies both functional and non-functional aspects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes activities like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.</li>
      <li>Conducted after code development and deployment.</li>
      <li>Detects runtime errors, behavioral issues, and user experience problems.</li>
      <li>Examples: Manual/automated test execution, performance testing, security testing.</li>
    </ul>
