    <h1 class="post-title">Software Quality Definition</h1>
    <p>
      Software quality refers to the degree to which a software product meets its specified requirements and satisfies the needs and expectations of its users. It is an indicator of how reliable, efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly the software is.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">What Does Software Quality Mean?</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, quality is described as "fitness for purpose." For software, this means the product not only functions as intended but is also usable, secure, and performs well under various conditions. High-quality software should be defect-free, delivered on time, within budget, and maintainable.
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Key Characteristics of Software Quality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Correctness:</b> Software correctly implements all specified requirements.</li>
      <li><b>Reliability:</b> The software operates consistently without failures over time.</li>
      <li><b>Usability:</b> Different users can easily learn and use the software effectively.</li>
      <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Optimal use of computing resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.</li>
      <li><b>Maintainability:</b> The ease with which software can be modified to correct faults or improve functionality.</li>
      <li><b>Portability:</b> Ability of software to operate in different environments or platforms.</li>
      <li><b>Reusability:</b> Software modules can be reused in other applications or projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="post-heading-h2">Perspective on Software Quality</h2>
    <p>
      Software quality depends both on the product itself and the processes used to develop it. It involves:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Product Quality:</b> How well the delivered software meets functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
      <li><b>Process Quality:</b> The discipline and methodologies applied during development, testing, and maintenance, which influence the final quality.</li>
    </ul>
